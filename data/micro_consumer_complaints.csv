Then two days ago, i had a payment that was being sent to me for {$2800.00}. I accepted the payment and attempted to transfer the funds, but then received an email from VENMO that said the following "" Your Venmo account has been suspended due to recent activity that appears to be a violation of our User Agreement. If you would like to reactivate your account, please reply to this email with a picture of your unexpired US government issued photo identification to begin the review. '' I had no idea what the issue was, but sent a picture of my ID immediately. Then I called them and tried to find out what was going on and spoke to a CSR who informed me that they could not see any details on my account, that it had to be handled by an "" account specialist '' and that they would be back in touch within 3-5 business days! I asked to speak to the account specialist, but they said they do n't have phones, and only correspond via email. I could n't believe it and pushed to speak to a mgr and after being on hold for over 30 minutes, a mgr came on the phone and said that they would expedite my request to the account specialist and would ask that they contact me. I waited all day and then at XXXX last night, received an email stating that they could not resolve the issue because "" I had not sent a copy of my bank statement '' No one had told me or asked for my bank statement in their previous communique and to be honest, I do not feel comfortable sending it. I then went online and did some research and saw hundreds of complaints posted saying that VENMO kept their money and never gave it back and the amounts all ranged around {$2500.00}. They talked about the same issues i was dealing with, with no answers, no way to reach anyone that could assist and no resolution. I now suspect that what they do is "" flag '' any transaction that is in that {$2500.00} range and use any excuse to hold the funds. Imagine if they are doing this to millions of people? 

If they have some kind of rule that is violated ( unbeknownst to the parties involved ), why not stop the transaction, not accept the funds and let the two parties involved know that it wo n't be going through? Instead what they do is TAKE the money, and then hold it in their accounts and not give it back to the person that paid the funds nor do they give it to the person that is owed the money. That seems highly illegal. 

I would appreciate your assistance in helping me get this resolved. Not just for me, but I believe there could be a major scam going on here, with millions of people using VENMO and it needs to be brought to light.

367306,Checking or savings account,"I requested a Bill Payment from the Wells Fargo Online Bill Pay service to pay a property tax payment with the county. A payment of {$5200.00} was due on XX/XX/XXXX. I scheduled a payment on XX/XX/XXXX for that amount. The county treasurer requires the payment be "" postmarked '' by the due date. 

The check was received by the county on XX/XX/XXXX without any mark on the envelope to indicate when it was ordered, issued or mailed ( due to the nature of the bulk mail. Because of this I was charged {$520.00} as a "" late fee '' despite having ordered my payment and had it in the post for delivery on XX/XX/XXXX. The county was unwilling to waive this fee due to `` county law '' requiring a  physical postmark. 

When I complained to Wells Fargo that there was no indication, notification or warning about the lack of postmarks on bills mailed through their "" Bill Pay '' service, they refused to compensate me in any way or recognize the lack of adequate disclosure in their service. When I asked where this information was conferred to the customer, they referenced their Online Access agreement, which was no less than 7 clicks away ( outside of the BillPay application itself, listed under "" Customer Support '', not under the Privacy/Security/Legal link on the bottom of the page ). Deep within another subsection and heading, finally in the bowels of hundreds of pages of fine print, there is an obscure reference to the reliability of postmarks amongst XXXX clauses to help XXXX the consumer over in multiple different exception scenarios. 

No normal human would ever find this information in the normal flow of paying a bill, let alone in the process of opening an account. No notification was given, no guaranteed delivery date offered, and after multiple conversations with the bank and the county office, it became evident that the county office was receiving payments in a single envelope that had been issued across multiple days of customer requests in the Bill Pay system ( the result of a bulk mail vendor relationship the bank uses to cut costs ). 

This is completely unacceptable. Human readable, discoverable and relevant information needs to be provided to a consumer when they are accessing services designed to "" pay bills '' the same as when they are borrowing money. In reading through the agreement it is evident that the fine print is intended to completely absolve the bank of any liability for actually paying bills, and rather to allow for every possible exception to the expectation that they actually reliably deliver the service they advertise.

262971,Vehicle loan or lease,"I paid off the loan on a new vehicle 12 months in advance. Ally Financial took one additional payment of {$530.00} out of my direct payment account and has NOT returned it to me in 30 days. I contacted customer service reps. at Ally seven times. I recorded four conversations ( I informed them that I was recording the conversation every time. ) I contacted Ally three additional times by "" chat '', and I printed those communications as well. 

I was initially told by Ally that I would receive the refund of my money the week of XX/XX/XXXX. I was told the refund was mailed to me on XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX and finally on XX/XX/XXXX. It is now XX/XX/XXXX and I still have not received the money Ally took out of my account. 

The vehicle was paid in full on XX/XX/XXXX ... 12 months ahead of when the final payment was due. I have recordings and documented copies of the misleading information I have been given for the last three weeks. 

Why are they allowed to get away with this? Why couldn't they return my money electronically to the same account they took it out of? Why are seven different people confused and not sure of "" exactly '' what is happening? 

Another complaint about the TITLE for the vehicle. I actually paid off, in full, two loans years ahead of time. I asked the question ; "" ... when will I receive the titles for the two vehicles? '' I was told by three reps. that the titles would be send to the DMV. I asked "" ... what DMV? '' No one could answer that question. However, as it turned out, one title WAS sent to the DMV in XXXX, IA. and second title was sent directly to ME! 

How about that? Who really knows what they are doing at Ally? Why would Ally release two vehicle tiles worth {$50000.00} and NOT return a payment amount of only {$530.00} ... what is worth more? It makes no sense that they would delay returning a small amount of money, but have NO problem releasing titles worth many thousands of dollars? The fact is, they DO NOT want to release MONEY. They hold on to the money as long as they want to, without reason or justifiable cause to do so.

This needs to be examined and corrected. Note : Ally should be regulated to "" refund '' customer 's money within two weeks or less. They should be forced to "" direct deposit '' refunds if they have been paid by "" direct payments '', all of my payments were made on time with direct payment terms.

263405,Vehicle loan or lease,"I am disputing every late payment reported by XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX on my Credit. They  fraudulently charged me auto insurance I was not aware of for years. I paid this loan off at the beginning of XX/XX/XXXX after confusion of getting a refund check in XX/XX/XXXX which was the month my last payment would have been. I have this title and they are still reporting me as not paying this loan off and 90 days late at this point. Please see below for chain of events. I do not believe them in anything they say at this point. They have outright lied to me. 

XX/XX/XXXX received a letter that stated internal processing errors for the months of XX/XX/XXXX XX/XX/XXXX had affected the way they posted my payments and credits of any late fees that had been paid would be credited to the account. Ive attached said letter. Also stated any issues that had been reported to the credit agencies would be corrected within 30 days. They have told me none of the credit updating has been done as of XX/XX/XXXX and would not be done until sometime towards the middle of the year. 

XX/XX/XXXX I received a refund check for {$280.00}. I thought it had to do with them correcting the way my payments were applied. The letter stated that credits would be issued to the accounts. Since they sent a check and I thought I had overpaid my loan. This would have been my last payment due month. I therefore waited for my title. They would not have sent me a refund if I still owed them for my loan it would have been credited to my loan balance. 

XX/XX/XXXX I pulled my credit towards at the end of the month so I could start making sure I could get a loan for a house. I see I have an outstanding balance of {$620.00} showing from Wells Fargo on my car loan. I got online with my bank and made the payment immediately. 

XX/XX/XXXX my payment post in the amount of {$620.00} in my bank. 

XXXX XXXX statement received showing no payment posted to my account and there was a balance of only {$420.00}. I thought there was a delay posting it. I once again thought I over paid my loan by {$190.00}. Tried to call but its ridiculous to get someone on the phone. I verified through my bank that they received it. 

XX/XX/XXXX Wells Fargo called me and said I owed them {$420.00} - the majority being late charges or I couldnt have my car title. I said late charges for what? I then demanded to know what was going on and why did I receive a refund check on my loan in XX/XX/XXXX. They stated they had no record of a refund check but I couldnt have my title unless I paid late fees. I paid immediately to get this off my credit and told them I wanted a call back regarding where these late fees came from and what that refund of {$280.00} was for. I asked again why I got a check if I owed you on my loan. I was also told that they received my payment on XX/XX/XXXX but it must have just been an oversight the way my XX/XX/XXXX Statement printed. I said that makes no sense. Noone has ever called to explain and since then Ive learned of the Insurance Fraud they committed. 

XX/XX/XXXX my Title is sent with a letter stating my loan was satisfied on XX/XX/XXXX XX/XX/XXXX Wells Fargo did a hard pull of my credit I was not aware of I owed them nothing and Im not sure its legal for them to do this since my account had been closed and I never authorized this. 
XX/XX/XXXX Im informed I could not prequalify for a mortgage because of Wells Fargo and I was being reported 80 days late at that time. I asked for them to send me the credit report and I had no idea what was going on that Wells Fargo had made a mess the past few months but that car was paid off. 
XX/XX/XXXX I was horrified when I saw the Wells Fargo report on my. I had been reported late 19 times. I called them. I told them I had been waiting on a call about why I received a refund check and I remembered a letter came with it and I wanted them to pull it up and tell me what it said. Depending on who I talked to they denied sending me a refund check. They also told me they have no access to letters that are sent out. I was transferred numerous times. I was constantly told the next department could tell me about the refund check and the letter then I would be told that again. XXXX and XXXX work in the CPI department and they explained they had charged me car insurance and that my payments were being applied to their car insurance and not my loan. I said why were you charging me car insurance I have car insurance?! They said they thought their customers did not have enough so they added it for us. I was livid and said you have ruined my credit! They said they were sorry they understood the frustration but it was going to take months to continue to unravel everyones accounts. I said I dont have months I am trying to buy a house. I then realized the refund check had to do with their fraudulent insurance scandal and not my loan. I never authorized them to charge me for insurance so I had no idea the refund had nothing to do with my loan. I demanded to go higher up to straighten this out and ended up with the office of the president. I have a case number XXXX. I have been calling them consistently only to get the run around. They are working on everyone as quickly as they can is all they can say. They refuse to send me the letter that came in XX/XX/XXXX that had very specific months that I remembered reading. They have verbally told me the months they charged me CPI that I was unaware was : 1. XX/XX/XXXX 2. XX/XX/XXXX 3. XX/XX/XXXX 4. XX/XX/XXXX 5. XX/XX/XXXX 6. XX/XX/XXXX 7. XX/XX/XXXX 8. XX/XX/XXXX 9. XX/XX/XXXX 10. XX/XX/XXXX 11. XX/XX/XXXX 12. XX/XX/XXXX 13. XX/XX/XXXX 14. XX/XX/XXXX 15. XX/XX/XXXX I was told I was making overpayments from XX/XX/XXXX XX/XX/XXXX so they never reported me late. This is not true as by my credit report and I am a single mother and could not have paid the {$1000.00} a month she is claiming I was making. My credit report also shows my loan was consistently going down approximately the same amount every month which means its how the payments were being applied and not that they werent getting them. One month shows the loan balance stayed the same and Im not sure why. That was XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX which is also when according to their records they began charging me insurance again that I was unaware of. I am disputing if any late reports were made to my credit on those months. 

XX/XX/XXXX I called Wells Fargo since my assigned person XXXX did not call me Friday as promised. She was away from her desk and I was told that nothing had even started on my case once again. I said I have a letter from XX/XX/XXXX that you were supposed to start unraveling my account. I said I paid almost {$400.00} in late fees to get this off my credit. She said yes and youll probably get a refund of those when we get your account straightened out. I then demanded XXXX get on the phone. She wanted me to send her all the documentation I have. I said you can pull everything up in your computer. She said no we dont have access to everything. I then begged her to at least report my loan was paid and closed to the credit agencies and please start with XX/XX/XXXX through today and remove my late fees. There would be no late fees if I didnt get a refund check on something I had no knowledge they were doing to me. I said your statement on XX/XX/XXXX shows I owed you {$420.00} and I had made a payment of {$620.00} on XX/XX/XXXX that was not on that statement so I thought I overpaid you once again. I said the girl I just spoke to said when you ever get around to going through my account Ill get a refund of the almost {$400.00} in late fees I paid in good faith in XX/XX/XXXX. She said she would see what she could do about at least getting XX/XX/XXXX through today late reporting removed due to their Insurance program and all of the confusion is has caused and call me XX/XX/XXXX. I told her I was going to have to dispute this on my credit and report them to the Consumer Finance agency and she said no dont do that that just slows the process down. I said ok then you have unit Wednesday. She didnt call. 

Today I got notice that they once again they have now reported me 90 days late on a car I have a title on. They are still reporting {$70.00} late that shows was the past due amount in XX/XX/XXXX that should have been covered by the {$620.00} check that dont show on my statement as being paid. I called Wells Fargo and they said their reporting is on an automatic update so there is nothing they can do to speed up saying my car has been paid off or removing the times they counted me as delinquent. She also said they havent been able to go through all of my payments history but they did see they made a mistake in XX/XX/XXXX so right now they owe me {$11.00}. She didnt know when they could go through the rest of my account. I said XXXX at XXXX in the CPI department said I wasnt reported late that month. She has no explanation for anything. 

Not only am I disputing if any late reports came from the months listed above when they were charging me for insurance and applying my payments to that instead of my loan I am disputing : 1. XX/XX/XXXX 2. XX/XX/XXXX 3. XX/XX/XXXX 4. XX/XX/XXXX 5. XX/XX/XXXX All of these stem from the confusion of the refund check in XX/XX/XXXX for their Insurance Fraud. A statement sent to me on XX/XX/XXXX that showed a balance and no payment had been made which would have paid that balance in full on XX/XX/XXXX. They car was paid off including any fraudulent late fees that I was charged on XX/XX/XXXX.",7

I called a few weeks after making the payment to discuss the unemployment coverage and was told that since I was not collecting unemployment ( I had been denied my state unemployment benefits ) that I don't qualify to use the coverage I'd agreed to when I signed my contract. I asked if there was anything they could do to help to which they said no. I asked to cancel the upcoming payment since it was set up for auto withdrawal ( since I knew I wouldn't have the money the payment ). I had accepted a job through a temp staffing company but it wasn't due to start until the end of XXXX. I started conversing with my loan company around the beginning of office, I advised them I was trying to keep my car from being repossessed and if they took their auto payment it would overdraw my account causing more issues and risk me losing my car.

Turns out the company still tried to withdraw the money from my account and I had to file a dispute with my bank and nearly lost my car. They even tried to make another auto pay withdrawal again on XX/XX/XXXX and I am disputing it again.

I needed ( one ) crown on my last back left upper tooth. After waiting to go into the room, aI got several ex-rays ( at least 20 ) it was  uncomfortable and hurt when the assistant did one of them, but didnt want to say anything. After three hours the Dentist XXXX XXXX was not there and still waiting. So while waiting I overheard an upset customer arguing with the Front Desk Manager for 20 minutes at least. I asked the assistant what was going on and she told me it wasnt the Dr. it was the Front Desk Manager. I asked the assistant when the Dr. was going to be coming in, she said she has to drive a ways to get there. So finally when she came she said besides the back last upper top left tooth that needs a crown ( which I know I needed one from what my regular Dentist said, XXXX XXXX ) she said I needed another one that is eventually going to crack. So she started to do my temporaries and it was very painful, I felt the shots and when she worked on the last back tooth, she said she couldnt give me a shot there. I was there 4 hours and left. 
My mouth hurt four days after that day, and my last upper temporary came out and I had only been eating soft foods, because I never been to XXXX XXXX, I wanted to be careful, and it did feel like excess stuff was on my teeth where she worked on and didnt feel the same as when I had other crowns done before from my regular Dentist, XXXX XXXX. 

XX/XX/2018 I went to my regular Dentist, XXXX because I didnt want to go back to XXXX after what I been through. My regular Dentist re-did my temporary and said XXXX didnt even fit it properly to my tooth, ( which leads me to believe the crowns they did would not fit properly either if the temporaries were not done properly ) so I would eventually have to get it done elsewhere which is my regular Dentist.

155360,Credit card or prepaid card,"Overview : The Wells Fargo Signature Visa Card advertises that points are worth {$1.00} per 100 points when redeemed for cash and {$1.00} per 100 points when redeemed for airline tickets. Last year I redeemed points without any issues. This year I redeemed points that were redeemed and charged per the above conversion rate of {$1.00} per 100 points for airline tickets. However, per the following details, Wells Fargo actually obtained super discounted group block rate tickets with major restrictions beyond standard airline tickets, the most extreme being the inability to select or confirm seats until check-in. 

My initial written complaint to Wells Fargo was rejected, based upon their interpretation of terminology contained in one of their many on-line Terms and Conditions. 

I then filed a complaint with the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX. After this complaint was filed, I was called by representatives of Wells Fargo who indicated that some type of "" error '' had occurred. My flight ( leaving for XXXX XX/XX/18 XXXX was already overbooked so they could not fix the "" error '' by reserving any seats on my flight, which seems to indicate that the type of tickets Wells Fargo reserved were somewhere between standard tickets and standby tickets. They said that I would probably have seating somewhere on the airplane due to the early date of my reservation, but that even if seats were available at check-in the odds of having 2 seats together were minimal. 

Wells Fargo finally replaced my XXXX reservation with one on XXXX XXXX on the same dates but not at as convenient a time. This time with reserved seats but not the airline I originally chose. 

Several issues remain : 1 ) I consider Wells Fargo 's action as to me personally as more of a Mitigation of Damages than a Full Resolution of my issue. 

2 ) The most important issue is that Wells Fargo initially defended their actions as consistent with their standard business business practices, but then only contended there was an "" error '' after I filed a formal Complaint w/ XXXX XXXX XXXX ( I am not sure what the current status of that Complaint is, but they also suggested I share the same information with the CFPB ). My strong suspicion is that Wells Fargo is also using the same process for thousands of their other customers and will continue doing so until the issue becomes public and you require Wells Fargo to stop this procedure. 

3 ) Airlines may be also be knowingly or unknowingly complicit in this process by delivering E-tickets to customers showing the full price of their standard retail tickets. This might have the legitimate purpose of keeping discounts and/or rebates secret from full price customers. It might also be a process similar to when auto manufacturers provide "" list price '' documentation to dealers to assist sales negotiations - but everyone knows how this works. For Wells Fargo to advertise a credit card based on a specific rewards value process, redeem points based on the full retail cost of standard airline tickets - but then actually deliver discount tickets one step above standby tickets is dishonest and probably fraudulent. 

These are the details : I located a XXXX XXXX ( XXXX ) flight from XXXX to XXXX, XXXX for XX/XX/2018, returning from XXXX to XXXX on XX/XX/2018. Instead of purchasing two round-trip tickets, total price {$1600.00}, I asked Wells Fargo 's Go Far Rewards to get the tickets for me based on redeeming some of my credit card points. 

The reservation was done at some point, and my account was charged XXXX points based on an advertised conversion rate of 100 points per {$1.00} of tickets ' price. For some time I was unable to get verification from XXXX that reservations were actually made, so I called Wells Fargo for assistance. After several revised confirmation letters from Go Far Rewards, Wells Fargo finally claimed in writing and during a phone call from their executive offices that my reservations were appropriately made pursuant to what was allowed per their standard Terms and Conditions. 

It appears that Wells Fargo has been using a travel agency called XXXX XXXX to outsource airline ticket purchases. It turns out that XXXX XXXX did not make reservations for and purchase the XXXX XXXX tickets I requested, but instead purchased super-discounted agency tickets from XXXX with special restrictions. This information was confirmed by friends in XXXX who contacted XXXX directly and confirmed that the tickets that had been reserved for me were not standard XXXX tickets but instead special discount tickets. XXXX would not verify the exact amount of the discount but only said this class of ticket was considerably discounted from their standard ticket 's retail price. 

The area of most concern is that with the tickets purchased by XXXX XXXX, seat reservations cant be made until flight check-in, contrary to standard XXXX tickets where seats can be reserved and even upgraded immediately. This means that its possible there may not be any available seats by check-in, and even if seats are still available, there's no way to confirm people can sit together. I had enough concerns having 2 seats in separate areas of an airplane for an almost 12 hour international flight. Imagine the same issues for a family of 5? 

It appears these super-discounted tickets are meant for corporate travel management companies and group tours handled by travel agencies where the travel management company or travel agency coordinates seating and obtains discounts to lower overall airline costs, what their clients are concerned with. This doesn't work for individuals making travel plans assuming they are actually getting standard airline tickets. 

Last year when I redeemed points for 4 airline tickets from XXXX XXXX to XXXX XXXX XXXX my points were redeemed for standard tickets. I was able to immediately reserve airline seats to ensure we all sat together. One strange did happen however. Because of a slight change in airline departure time, I was given written notification of the change, but for some reason notification re : 2 tickets came from Wells Fargo and notification for 2 of the tickets came from XXXX XXXX. Im assuming they were undergoing some issues with a transition. 

What seems to have happened over the past year is that at least a portion of the work of Wells Fargo 's Go Far Rewards Fulfillment Department has been outsourced to XXXX XXXX. My understanding if that XXXX XXXX primarily provides Corporate Travel Management Services to Wells Fargo to manage and reduce costs for internal Wells Fargo business travel. They may also  operate in some situations as a regular Travel Agency. Im not sure what type of financial arrangement Wells Fargo has with XXXX XXXX, but its clear that Wells Fargo does not generally make their existence public, except for notification within their on-line Terms and Conditions. All written documentation now comes on Wells Fargo letterhead, and when you call Wells Fargo about a Go Far Rewards travel issue, you will probably eventually be transferred to a XXXX XXXX employee without any notification as to who they are. When XXXX XXXX supervisors have called me they identify themselves as calling from Wells Fargo 's XXXX XXXX. I'm not sure if this general lack of transparency as to the existence of XXXX XXXX is relevant, but it might be something to note. 

Wells Fargo seems to possibly be defrauding at least a portion of their Signature Visa Card customers. It is possible that my situation is an isolated incident and individual "" error. '' However, based on the details of my complaint and Wells Fargo 's recent track record, it seems probable there are many other cases involving other Wells Fargo customers. 

I would greatly appreciate your assistance.",4

XX/XX/XXXX, I began to receive calls and emails from ClearOne saying they had come to a settlement agreement with XXXX XXXX on a credit card, from {$23000.00} down to about {$9500.00}, in payments over a couple of years. While I was glad for a possible settlement, I was due to receive a sizable bonus XX/XX/XXXX and wanted to pay it off all at once, knowing a lump sum payment would result in an even lower settlement. I expressed this interest and set up a special draft for {$9000.00} XX/XX/XXXX. A few days later I began to receive calls notifying me that a settlement for {$8300.00} had been reached, but again spreading the payments out over a number of months, the first being {$10.00} followed by significantly higher payments the remaining months. I was told that this would be the best settlement, and that with a lump sum XXXX XXXX would actually want more money. ( This was later found by myself to be a lie ). This is when what only be described as harassment began. My wife began to receive numerous phone calls and emails every day urging us to accept the offer. While we were still hesitant and wanted to call XXXX XXXX to ask about a lump sum ourselves, due to the near constant stream of calls, emails and text messages we went ahead and accepted, with the full intention of calling XXXX XXXX ourselves and settling in a lump sum. What we were not told at the time was that by accepting this settlement we were also accepting the ClearOne Advantage fee, which was XXXX % of the ORIGINAL debt, to the amount of {$5800.00}. This, by their contract, is "" locked in '' when the first payment is made ( which now shows me why the {$10.00} initial payment was made so promptly ). 

This was all discovered by me after negotiating with XXXX XXXX for a significantly lower lump sum payment of {$7600.00}. 

So, in the end I have XXXX issues : The harassment to accept the settlement I asked for a lump sum settlement for this particular account, and made funds available to do so. I was told this was not possible - this was a lie. 
When accepting the settlements, the fact that this would also accept the fees with ClearOne, with the amount of said fees should be part of the settlement agreement. So instead of the agreement simply showing the {$8300.00}, it should explain that it would also result in the {$5800.00} fee, to a total of {$14000.00}.",12

514000,Bank account or service,Navy Federal has decided to practice extremely unfair mobile deposit practices. Their terms and condition state that you have to receive a approval email before XXXX otherwise it will not get processed that day. Although their customer service team clearly tells you that you can make a deposit at XXXX and it will be processed that day. Their is an approximate. 2-6 minute delay in their approval and you receiving the email. And their customer service also informed me that the approval time can take anywhere 20 minutes to 2 hours depending on how busy the bank is. By the impression your customer service gives it is clear that there is some give time in the processing time if you can submit a deposit at the very last second. This is not true. If you do not receive your approve before XXXX you will have to wait 24-48 business hours to get your check approved. No matter what time you submitted your deposit. All this is of course based of the bank time table and their app clock which you as a customer have no way of verify is correct nor do you get any sort of warning prior to depositing that it is close to their cut off time since this is a national bank that runs of EST but if you are n't in EST obviously XXXX EST would be a different time for you. So when I called and was informed their would be a two day hold on my check till tuesday I was upset and all I was told was the term and conditions were clear. Which they clearly are not since their own customer service team either 1 ) does not understand them or 2 ) is intentionally giving customers wrong information so that they will use their overdraft protection and the bank can charge a fee. Either way this huge disconnect in process time is an issue that is not clearly explained to customers and requires a lot of explanation. I have received multiple answers on the timeline of my claim. My check was approved sometime between XXXX EST and XXXXXXXX XXXX EST. No clear answer to that. The app says XXXX approved. One representatives said XXXX another said XXXX but the email was not sent till XXXX. the timeline process is horrendous and seems to benefit Navy Federal how they please,9

262991,Mortgage,"I attempted to get a lower interest rate on my HELOC that BOA was advertising. After spending weeks answering questions and filling out paperwork the bank told me my house was not worth {$120000.00}. Therefore, they could not give me a line of credit for {$100000.00}, which was way more than I wanted to borrow. However, they would not give me the lower interest rate unless I could borrow up to that amount. I told them never mind but then they told me my old HELOC was no longer valid and made me sign for a new one I did not even want at a much higher rate. 

There is no balance on this account and I tried to close it because it was increasing my debt to income ratio. I called "" XXXX '' on XX/XX/XXXX and she informed me they would close it and when I asked about any fees, she told me there were none associated. Reference # XXXX. I went to the bank a few weeks ago and talked to XXXX XXXX. He explained that my LOC was never closed and when we called their department, they claimed I had to pay a {$74.00} fee. I did not have my reference number. 
Subsequently, ( XX/XX/XXXX ) I called and spoke to XXXX at BOA. I provided the reference number and explained the situation. He told me it was a county fee and I had to pay it. I asked for a supervisor and was left on hold for over ten minutes. When he returned he said the supervisors were too busy to speak to me and too bad pretty much. Therefore, I thanked him and advised him that I would file a complaint. 

Significantly, I had went to XXXX a few months after applying at BOA for a HELOC and they estimated my home 's worth at 150 - 165,000. As a result, I think that BOA is conducting a bait and switch scheme by offering low HELOC rates and then duping the applicants into believing they do not qualify or their home is not worth enough. I have excellent credit so they could not disqualify me there, instead they claim my house isn't worth anything. Consequently, they then talk you into a much higher rate. And just to add insult to injury they want a fee of {$74.00} when I try to close it. Why had XXXX said there were no fees and now all of a sudden there is one? Also, don't they record your conversations for quality assurance? That's what the recording says ...",3

On XX/XX/XXXX I contacted XXXX separate Ally representatives ( XXXX and XXXX ) via Ally 's account chat feature to request that the extra payments be applied to principal only. The reps said they would apply the total amounts to principal. The XXXX representatives stated that any future extra payments that I want to make to principal only can be accomplished if I make a request after the payment by phone or chat and then they would adjust the payment to apply to principal only ( chat sessions attached ). 

On XX/XX/XXXX I viewed my account to make sure Ally had applied the extra payments to principal but instead they had added XXXX confusing transactions to my account and I could not determine if the amounts were applied to principal. Furthermore, there is no itemization on my account which shows how each of the transactions affected the principal amount. 

On XX/XX/XXXX I telephoned Ally and spoke to XXXX ( refused last name ) and she avoided my question multiple times when I asked her to explain why they created the XXXX additional confusing transactions for just XXXX payment adjustments. The descriptions for the transaction types vary greatly and they make no sense considering I only asked for XXXX simple payment adjustments.

XXXX said that even if I request the extra payments be applied as principal only, interest will still be charged despite what the other XXXX reps told me.

575442,Consumer Loan,"I had an auto loan with Bank of America. That auto loan was fully paid-off in XXXX of 2016 -- no dispute on that fact. 
In XXXX we have an "" electronic title '' system, where once a lien is fully paid-off, the lender ( BofA in this case ) is obligated to then release the title to the State of XXXX, who then ensures that the XXXX DMV has a record of the title being free of encumbrances. At that point, as the owner of the vehicle ( free and clear ), I am supposed to be able to go process a sale of my car with little effort, again, since the XXXX DMV should now have the clear title in their systems, ready for transfer. 
It turns out that for whatever reason in my case BofA failed to release the title. The XXXX DMV still shows the lien recorded against it, and BofA, when contacted admitted "" Oh, yes, we can see that the release was never completed. '' The problem I am facing is that I am moving from XXXX to XXXX next week, and as part of that process it is essential that I sell my car ... i can no longer do that because I do n't have the title. And because BofA will take 7-10 business days to process the release ( again, a release that they were supposed to process 9+ months ago ), and the XXXX systems take 7-10 business days of their own to update once the release is received form the bank, I am left to wait out approximately a month before I will have access to the title I should have access to today. 
The impact for me is that I guess I will need to reschedule my movers, my home sale and my transportation across the country -- seemingly thousands of dollars of impact. And thus far the response from BofA has been "" yeah, sorry about that. '' In particular, I took note of the comment from the Customer Service Supervisor when I was asking how this could have happened in the first place and why the bank never caught the problem until I called. He told me "" we do n't have any process to check if the release actually occurs. And we do n't have any staff that is assigned to follow-up on that. '' They actually just wait for their clients to catch it and then it is our responsibility to follow-up, figure out what has happened, and in my case at least, be left with the huge financial impact of their failure.
